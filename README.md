## About me

I'm a student of Japanese language at the **University of Ca' Foscari** in Venice and I'm currently doing an exchange program at Hokkaido University in the _Graduate School of Media, Communication and Tourism Studies_. I will be in Sapporo until the 8th of September. 

## My projects

I still don't have a project lol. But I'm start thinking about my Master Thesis.
