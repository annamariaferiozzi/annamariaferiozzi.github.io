## About me

Hello everyone! My name is Anna Maria Feriozzi. 

I'm a student of the Master Course _Language and Civilisation of Asia and Mediterranean Africa_, Japanese curriculum at the **University of Ca' Foscari** in Venice. I'm currently doing an exchange program as a Special Auditor at Hokkaido University in the _Graduate School of Media, Communication and Tourism Studies_. Besides Japanese language corses, I'm doing lectures such as Tourist Attractions, Art Tourism, Enviromental society and Search Strategies. 

I finished last year a Bachelor's Degree in Japanese Language, Culture and Societies and this gave me an understanding about international communication, Japanese cultural studies and linguistic studies. After finishing my Master course, I want to work as cultural and museum organizations, professions related to the organisation and promotion of cultural and artistic events and work for companies and organisations interested in the Asian and African Mediterranean markets. Tourism studies helped me to reach this goal. 

With my job experiences I've gained experience in leading tour or park groups, in the publishing industry as publisher and shop cashier.
